I am Ali Eren Ak, a **Junior Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Sabanci University**, Turkey. I am also enrolled to **Art Theory and Criticism** minor, with doing that I pursue multi-disciplinary undergraduate degree which helped me to understand the world from a broad perspective. I have a huge interest in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**, and I am especially enthusiastic about **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**.

I am also part of **SabancÄ± University NLP Group** directed by **Reyyan Yeniterzi**, where I focused on transformer-based **Large Scale Language Models** and **Named Entity Recognition**. I am also part-time Data Scientist at **YAZI AI** where I have a chance to apply state-of-the-art Deep Learning models to real life use-cases. Our startup focused on Social Media Text Analysis mostly in Turkish. Last summer, I was **Research Intern** at **UvA ILPS** under supervision of **Evangelos Kanoulas** and **Mohammad Aliannejadi**. I worked on **Attribute-Value Extraction from Product Profiles**.
